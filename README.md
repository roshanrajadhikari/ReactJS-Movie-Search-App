## Introduction

This project provides a user-friendly interface for searching and browsing movies.  It demonstrates the use of React components, asynchronous data fetching with `fetch` or `axios` (specify which you used), and state management to create a dynamic and interactive web application.  The app focuses on providing a smooth search experience and clear presentation of movie information.

## Features

- **Movie Search:** Search for movies by title.
- **Detailed Movie Information:** View details about each movie, including poster, title, year, and other relevant information from the OMDb API.  (Be specific about what details are shown.)
- **Responsive Design:**  The app is designed to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Loading State:**  A loading indicator is displayed while movie data is being fetched. (If implemented)
- **Error Handling:**  The app handles API errors and displays appropriate messages to the user. (If implemented)
- **No Results Handling:**  A message is displayed if no movies are found for a given search term. (If implemented)
